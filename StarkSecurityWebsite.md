### Penetration Testing

So you've got door locks, cameras and the latest firewall and you feel pretty safe right? But have you tested those defenses against a motivated attacker? 

We offer non-destructive penetration testing of your cyber & physical security controls.
This testing can range from internal vulnerability scanning of your network to external intrusion attempts of your network, building or both!

### Web Application Testing

Most people underestimate the capacity for their website to leak valuable information or even provide a foothold for a cyber criminal to operate inside their internal network.

We offer services to assess the attack surface of your Internet presence and work with your developers to ensure they are following best security practices.

### Secure Architecture Engineering

By understanding how to compromise security we know methods to prevent or deter would-be attackers. Our consultants can work with your security architects to cover all your bases to ensure your assets stay yours.

### Attacker Emulation

Do you have concerns about certain groups compromising your core assets? Many people don't realize that their competitors, nation state actors, or criminals are constantly trying to exploit a company's public presence. 
These actors often persist over months and years to understand  your security architecture and siphon the maximum amount of your assets and stay hidden with bleeding edge exploitation capabilities.

We work with companies to understand these threats and emulate them in order to assess the company's capacity to thwart a sophisticated threat. 
Such exercises enable our customers the ability to thwart future exploitation attempts by their adversaries.
It is our most comprehensive offering and will establish the most robust security footprint possible.
